Description: glmSparseNet is an R-package that generalizes sparse
    regression models when the features (e.g. genes) have a graph
    structure (e.g. protein-protein interactions), by including
    network-based regularizers.  glmSparseNet uses the glmnet R-package,
    by including centrality measures of the network as penalty weights in
    the regularization. The current version implements regularization
    based on node degree, i.e. the strength and/or number of its
    associated edges, either by promoting hubs in the solution or orphan
    genes in the solution. All the glmnet distribution families are
    supported, namely "gaussian", "poisson", "binomial", "multinomial",
    "cox", and "mgaussian".
